# Overview

The OWF is a consortium of companies and non-profit organisations collaborating
to drive global adoption of open, secure and interoperable digital wallet
solutions as well as providing access to expertise and advice through our
Government Advisory Council.

The OWF aims to set best practices for digital wallet technology through
collaboration on standards-based OSS components that issuers, wallet providers
and relying parties can use to bootstrap implementations that preserve user
choice, security and privacy.
